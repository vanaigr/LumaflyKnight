What counts as containing lumaflies:

<details>
  
- Poles, lamps, etc.
- Zombie miners (including Myla).
- Empty Junk Pit chest.

</details>

By default, after releasing lumafiles from an object, it will remain in its "after" state even after a room transition.
This can be disabled by setting `"permanentLumaflyRelease": false` in the mod's global settings.
